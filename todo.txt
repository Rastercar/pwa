1- learn to handle global state with apollo, we probably need to use local fields and
type policies for these fields

2- Change way to get auth token in apollo instance

2- Create way to have a folder of env jsons that are loaded dynamically
depending on how you start the app, just like in the api, and validate said envs

3- create way to extract errors from graphql, (return error code on the api ?)

4- integrate with a form validation lib

5- start work on route access authentication


---- NOTES ----

graphql values are reactive ! (thank god, whenever theyre updated the components react)
avaliable mutations are defined server side, client side can create their own definitions to query agains such mutations using variables
